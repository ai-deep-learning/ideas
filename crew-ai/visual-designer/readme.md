Currently there is a basic in-browser 
visual editor/deisgner for CrewAI.

We can create a library of pre-configured diagram elements and processors/generators + CLI command to
generate CrewAI artifacts from the diagrams. Generation of documentation web sites is already available. 

Generation can be done as part of the build pipeline, e.g. GitHub actions - change in a diagram triggers generation of sources. Commit of generated sources triggers further deployment.

TODO - add links to existing resources, elaborate.

We can then create a library of patterns.
